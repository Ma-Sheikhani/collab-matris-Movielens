Collaborative Filtering trained on Movielens data using pytorch

Data is from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

One very common problem to solve is when you have a number of users and a number of products, and you want to recommend which products are most likely to be useful for which users. 

There is a general solution to this problem, called collaborative filtering, which works like this: look at what products the current user has used or liked, find other users that have used or liked similar products, and then recommend other products that those users have used or liked.
